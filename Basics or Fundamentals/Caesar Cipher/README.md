# Caesar Cipher

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher project! This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique used to shift the letters of the alphabet by a certain amount, known as the shift or key. This project allows you to encode or decode messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features
- Encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Customizable shift amount for encoding and decoding.
- ASCII art logo for visual appeal.

## How to Use
1. Run `Caesar_Cipher.py` in a Python environment.
2. Choose whether to encode or decode a message.
3. Enter your message and specify the shift amount.
4. The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message.
5. You can also run on Replit: https://replit.com/@meet-vivek/Caesar-Cipher

# Command-Line Calculator

Welcome to the Python Command-Line Calculator project! This Python program is a simple calculator that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Interactive console-based interface.
- ASCII art logo for visual appeal.

## Python Concepts Used
- Functions: Utilized functions for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in a modular and reusable manner.
- Dictionaries: Employed dictionaries to store arithmetic operation symbols (+, -, *, /) as keys and corresponding function references as values, allowing for dynamic selection of operations based on user input.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run `calculator.py` in a Python environment.
4. You can run on Replit: https://replit.com/@meet-vivek/Calculator

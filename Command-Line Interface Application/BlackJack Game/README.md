# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game project! This Python-based game allows you to play the classic casino game of Blackjack against the computer. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over while competing against the computer dealer.

## Features
- Interactive console-based gameplay.
- Randomly generated card values to simulate real gameplay.
- Flexible scoring system with support for Blackjack and dynamic Ace values.]

## Python Concepts Used
- **Functions**: Used for modularizing code and defining actions like dealing cards, calculating scores, and comparing hands.
- **Loops**: Utilized to control the flow of the game, allowing repeated actions like dealing additional cards until the game is over.
- **Conditional Statements**: Employed to determine game outcomes based on user input and card values, such as determining if the player has Blackjack or has exceeded 21.
- **Lists**: Used to store and manipulate card values for both the player and the computer dealer.

# Welcome to Basics or Fundamentals!

This folder contains basic Python projects focusing on fundamental concepts to help beginners learn programming with Python.

## Projects:

1. **Hangman Game**: Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. With a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed, the challenge lies in guessing the word before completing the hangman drawing.

2. **Caesar Cipher**: Experience the art of encryption with the Python-based Caesar Cipher, where messages are encoded and decoded using a shift-based algorithm, adding an extra layer of security to your communication while delving into the fascinating world of cryptography.

3. **Calculator**: Empower your mathematical prowess with the Python Calculator, a versatile tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations effortlessly, offering a user-friendly interface and enhancing productivity in everyday calculations.

4. **Guess The Number**: Guess the Number is a Python-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. With options to choose between easy and hard difficulty levels, players can enjoy a challenging yet fun experience while honing their guessing skills.

5. **Blackjack Game**: The Blackjack Game project is a Python-based implementation of the classic casino card game. Players can enjoy interactive console-based gameplay, challenging themselves to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it while competing against a computer dealer. With randomly generated card values and flexible scoring mechanics, it offers an engaging and dynamic gaming experience.

6. **Higher-Lower Game**: The "Higher Lower" game challenges players to guess which social media influencer or entity has more followers. Players are presented with two options, and they must select the one they believe has the higher follower count. The game continues until an incorrect guess is made, and the final score is displayed. It's a fun and interactive way to test your knowledge of social media popularity!

7. **Coffee Machine**: The Coffee Machine project simulates the functionality of a real-life coffee machine, offering users a selection of drinks to choose from, managing resources, handling payments, and providing reports. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, this project provides a fun and interactive way to explore object-oriented programming principles in Python while learning about the operation of a coffee machine.

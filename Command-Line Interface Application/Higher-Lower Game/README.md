# Higher Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher Lower Game project! This Python-based game challenges you to compare the follower count of two randomly selected profiles from a dataset and guess which one has a higher count.

## Key Features:
- Compare follower counts between randomly selected profiles.
- Interactive command-line gameplay.
- Dynamic scoring system to track your progress.

## Python Concepts Used:
- **Random Module**
- **Functions:** Modularized code for dealing cards, calculating scores, and comparing hands.
- **Loops:** Controlled the flow of the game, allowing repeated actions like dealing additional cards.
- **Conditional Statements:** Determined game outcomes based on user input and card values, such as detecting Blackjack or exceeding 21.
- **Lists:** Stored and manipulated card values for both the player and the computer dealer.

## How to Play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `higher_lower_game.py` script.
3. Compare the follower count between two profiles.
4. Input your guess ('A' or 'B') on which profile has a higher follower count.
5. Earn points for correct guesses and see how high you can score!
6. You can run on Replit: https://replit.com/@meet-vivek/Higher-Lower-Game

# Quiz Game

This project is a Python-based quiz game that allows users to test their knowledge by answering true or false questions. It utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure the code and manage the quiz flow.

## Key Features
- Interactive quiz gameplay: Users can answer true or false questions presented in the quiz.
- Dynamic question loading: Questions are loaded from a data file, allowing for easy customization and expansion of the quiz.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz.
- User-friendly interface: The quiz game provides clear instructions and feedback to the user during gameplay.

## Python Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project uses classes and objects to represent questions, manage the quiz flow, and track the user's score.
- File Handling: Questions are loaded from an external data file (`data.py`), demonstrating file handling techniques in Python.
- User Input Handling: The game prompts users for input and validates their responses to ensure accurate quiz gameplay.

## Usage
1. Run the `QuizGame.py` file in your Python environment.
2. Answer each true or false question by typing "True" or "False" accordingly.
3. Receive instant feedback on your answer and see your score accumulate as you progress through the quiz.
4. Once you've completed all the questions, view your final score and see how well you did!

## Files
- **`QuizGame.py`**: Implements the main functionality of the quiz game, including quiz flow and user interaction.
- **`quiz_brain.py`**: Defines the `QuizBrain` class, which manages the quiz flow, tracks the user's score, and validates answers.
- **`question_model.py`**: Contains the `Question` class, representing individual quiz questions and their correct answers.
- **`data.py`**: Provides the data for the quiz questions in a list format, which is imported into the main script.
